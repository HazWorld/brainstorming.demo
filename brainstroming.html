        <h1>Brainstorming</h1>


        <p>To get started, get in a group of four and discuss what you know, or you think you know, about video games
            and
            violence. Your initial discussion should be based around the following points:

            examples of violent games you know/play
            the type of violence, i.e. fighting, shooting etc...
            what you feel when playing these violent games
            any real world cases of violence that have been related to video games
            your initial thoughts about the influence of violent games on behaviour.
